          <p>Match is divided into innings, where one team bats while the other team bowls and fields. The primary objective for the batting team is to score runs, while the bowling and fielding team aims to dismiss the batsmen and limit the runs scored. A run is scored when the batsmen successfully run between the wickets after hitting the ball. Dismissals can occur in various ways, such as being bowled, caught, run out, or leg before wicket (LBW).</p>
